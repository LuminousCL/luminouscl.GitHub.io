### Welcome to Kepler 452b

어둠이 드리워질 때도 겁내지 마

너무 아름다워서 꽃잎 활짝 펴서

언제나 사랑받는 아이 YoU 🦋

### About Me

Hi, this is Arthur :)
I'm a software engineer working on full-stack development, and  I'm also learning game grogramming, cloud computing, machine learning and mobile development.

Now I'm focused on:

1. Improving my code quality;
2. Combining machine learning with web development
3. Implementing IaaS based on OpenStack.

In my spare time, I love to play PS4/Switch, animation design, cook some food, enjoy pop music, and dabble in making art. It would be my honor to make acquaintance with you.
